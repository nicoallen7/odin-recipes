                        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>

                        <li><h2>Steps</h2></li>
                        <li>Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined;do not over beat.</li>
                        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper; season with salt and pepper. 
                        Cook and stir until onions soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed.
                            Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over omelet.</li>
                        <li>Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes.
                            Use a spatula to fold omelet in half and transfer it to a plate.</li>
